 = August Black ( aug.ment.org ) for the original graphic user interface
 = Asbesto Molesto ( freaknet.org ) for testing and documentation
 = Alex, Rasty and Martinez ( ! ) for the good vibes
 = Eric de Castro Lopo ( mega-nerd.com ) for libsnfile and secret rabbit code
 = Filippo "Godog" ( esaurito.net ) for docu, /debian and organization
 = Lobo for karma and herbivore which was a crucial tool for all developers
 = Matteo Nastasi for the first input channel resampling routines
 = SERVUS.AT trusting in this project since its early stage and supporting it
 = PUBLIC VOICE Lab ( pvl.at ) for further support and new horizons of use
