BUG REPORTING is REALLY APPRECIATED! BUT TAKE CARE TO DO IT WELL:
please ALWAYS REPORT the muse --version you are running and possibly
run the binary with gdb giving us the backtrace of the error.

go to http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=addbug&group=muse
and submit a BUG!!!

any MuSE (ab)user can join the mailing list, send a mail to
muse-subscribe@dyne.org

sometimes we are also on irc.freenode.net channel #muse
